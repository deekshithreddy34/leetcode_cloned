Leetcode Clone:
This project is a frontend-focused clone of Leetcode, built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It replicates the core problem-solving functionality of Leetcode, allowing users to view problems, write code in an in-browser editor, and test their solutions against predefined test cases.

Features:


*)Problem List View: Displays a list of coding problems fetched from the backend.

*)Problem Details Page: Each problem includes a description, constraints, and examples.

*)Code Editor: Built using Monaco Editor (the same editor used in VS Code), allowing users to write, edit, and test their code.

*)Code Execution: Submissions are sent to the backend where the code is executed against sample test cases using a secure code execution setup.

*)Submission Results: Displays real-time output, indicating whether the solution passed or failed the test cases.

*)Routing: Navigation is handled using React Router for smooth transitions between the problem list and individual problems.

Technologies Used:

*)Frontend

*)React (with hooks and functional components)

*)Tailwind CSS (for UI styling)

*)Monaco Editor (for code input)

*)React Router DOM

*)Backend

*)Node.js

*)Express.js

*)Firebase
